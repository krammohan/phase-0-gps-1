# Release 7: Reflect

* Prior to the GPS session, I was struggling a little bit to remember the commands needed for each step in the workflow.

* The GPS session really helped me further understand exactly what's going on behind each command that I type when I'm cloning, adding, committing, pushing, merging and more. Previously I was just blindly following the steps but now I have a deeper understanding of the process.

* My guide was very helpful in teaching me about proper workflow and conventions involved in using GitHub, and she also helped me remember each command by explaining all components of them so I would remember better.

* Until I have more practice with fetching and merging and pulling, I feel that those topics will be a little confusing for me still.

* Unfortunately, my partner was not available for the GPS this time. I'm really looking forward to next week's!
